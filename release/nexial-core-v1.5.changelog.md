### <a href="https://github.com/nexiality/nexial-core/releases/tag/nexial-core-v1.5_0189" class="external-link" target="_nexial_link">Release 1.5</a>
2018-09-03


### General
- upgraded to nexial-seeknow 1.1. Supports reading text pane with two gray variants of background colors.
- supports replacing multiple `(empty)`, `(blank)`, `(tab)` and `(eol)` with the appropriate values in the parameter. 
  For example, `(blank)(blank)(blank)` will now be replaced as `   ` (3 spaces).
- `nexial-variable-update.cmd|sh`: Added new command line option (`-p`) to preview variable updates. It won't update 
  variables just showcase which variables will be updated. 
- `nexial-variable-update.cmd|sh`: fixed wrong verbiage for option `-p`.
- `nexial-script-update.cmd|sh`: minor updates to output to improve clarity.
- `nexial.cmd|sh`: minor command line option help regarding multi-plan support.
- [`nexial.pauseOnError`](../systemvars/index#nexial.pauseOnError): **NEW** System variable to enable the pausing of
  execution when a FAIL is encountered. Can be combined in use with 
  [`nexial.inspectOnPause`](../systemvars/index#nexial.inspectOnPause)
- support specifying data variable override via command line. Same effect as using `set JAVA_OPT=-D...` but this may be 
  simpler for some folks.
- prevent the evaluation of fail-fast when command does not result in a FAIL condition (e.g. SKIP)
- JVM memory allocation settings are removed from `.commons` files. User can set through command line using `JAVA_OPT`
  option.
- [`nexial.currentActivity`](../systemvars/index#nexial.currentActivity): **NEW** System variable to indicate the 
  Activity currently in execution


### Nexial Filter
- fixed logic error with the ` contain ` filter. The corrected code works as a "contains one of ..." match.
- fixed code to handle variable substitution when evaluating filter.


### Built-in Function
- [`file`](../functions/$(file)): **NEW** built-in function to provide file-related functionality.
- fixed wrong references in `$(syspath|script)`
- support for `informal` date/time formatting to mimic human conversation.


### Nexial Expression

  conversation.
- [DATE expression](../expressions/DATEexpression): fixed date operation with negative values.


### [base commands](../commands/base)
- [`clear(vars)`](../commands/base/clear(vars)): improve output/console messages. No change in functionality/logic.


### [io commands](../commands/io)
- file validation support to give a choice to the user to define record spec configuration for any one record type or
  for a combination of the record types(file header, section header, section body, section footer, file footer).
- fix file validation support, for huge data files efficiently.  Improves performance in file parsing and validating.
- add **NEW** data types: `Any`, `REGEX`, `Person Name`, `Alpha`, `Alpha Upper` and `Alpha Lower`.
- [io &raquo; `writeFile(file,content,append)`](../commands/io/writeFile(file,content,append)): now consider the

#### [web commands](../commands/web)
- honor [`nexial.browser.forceJSClick`](../systemvars/index#nexial.browser.forceJSClick) so that if it is set to 
  `false` then Nexial will not automate `click` event via JavaScript. This might slightly improve execution performance
  and possibly reduce some flakiness.
- enable web element highlight during the execution of `assert`* commands. Note that [`nexial.web.highlight`] must be 
  set to `true` to activate web element highlighting.
- [`nexial.web.highlight`](../systemvars/index#nexial.web.highlight): renamed from the previous `nexial.highlight`
  System variable (which is still working) for consistency and clearer namespacing.
- [`nexial.web.highlight.waitMs`](../systemvars/index#nexial.web.highlight.waitMs): renamed from the previous 
  `nexial.highlightWaitMs` (which is still working) for consistency and clearer namespacing.
- [`nexial.web.highlight.style`](../systemvars/index#nexial.web.highlight.styl): **NEW** System variable to allow for
  customization of web element highlighting, which is assumed as CSS style. The default is `background:#faf557;`.
- [`saveTableAsCsv(locator,nextPageLocator,file)`](../commands/web/saveTableAsCsv(locator,nextPageLocator,file)): 
  **NEW** command to automate the collection of HTML table data into a CSV file.
- added firefox-specific fix for selecting option from a <SELECT> element. Only tested on single-option <SELECT> so far.

  locator to find cell data with more coverage.
- [`savePageAsFile(sessionId,url,file)`](../commands/web/savePageAsFile(sessionId,url,file)): shorten parameter 
  `fileName` to just `file`.

  elements.
- [`uncheckAll(locator)`](../commands/web/uncheckAll(locator)): **NEW** command to "uncheck" all matching CheckBox web 
  elements.
- [web &raquo; `checkAll(locator)`](../commands/web/checkAll(locator)): fixed code so that multiple matching web 
  elements are refetched after each `check`. This prevents the element staleness issue.
- [web &raquo; `uncheckAll(locator)`](../commands/web/uncheckAll(locator)): fixed code so that multiple matching web 
  elements are refetched after each `uncheck`. This prevents the element staleness issue.
