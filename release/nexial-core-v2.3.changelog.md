2019-06-03

### General
#### Fixes
- fixed error when dynamic data cannot be resolved during the initialization of an execution. This fix stabilize the 
  execution.
- fixed an parsing error to consider other character sequences that look like a Nexial Expression.
- add execute permission to `nexial-artifact-repair.sh` script.
- fixed excel file corruption after repairing file with `nexial-artifact-repair.cmd|sh` when there is data in last cell. 
  Added 10000 as a maximum row and column limit to read and write data of excel.

#### Improvements
- omit the creation of hyperlink on path longer than 254 characters; Excel doesn't support long path.
- updated to Kotlin 1.3.31, Spring 5, SpringBoot 2.1.4 - improved stability and performance.
- [`nexial-artifact-repair.cmd|sh`](../userguide/BatchFiles#nexial-artifact-repair): 
  **NEW** Nexial utility batch file to repair excel file (remove unnecessary links and comments).
- minor update to MacOSX/*NIX script to that focus will stay on terminal when Nexial execution commences.
- [`nexial-var-update.cmd|sh`](../userguide/BatchFiles#nexial-variable-update): 
  now support batch files and minor improvement to console output.
- more informative error messages when invalid or out-of-bound array index is referenced.
- console log hygiene; minor reduction of duplicated logs
