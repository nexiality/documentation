Nexial is designed to work with a variety of directory/file structures. One can specify target script or data file 
locations when running [`nexial.[cmd|sh]`](BatchFiles#nexial). However it is recommended to follow 
the standard Nexial automation project structure so that:
1. Test artifacts are well-organized to reduce conflicts and to improve artifact management,
2. Your project can integrate more easily with other project(s) (think Integration Testing) that follow the same 
   structure,
3. Automation is simplified since Nexial would derive most of the path-related work for you via the same common 
   convention.

Below is the general directory/file structure of a standard Nexial automation project:<br/>
![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_01.png)

### `.meta/project.id`
Strictly, this is not a required file. It helps to keep all instances of the same project on using the same name, 
and thus easier to manage across participants and teams. Let's further understand the underlying problem via an 
example. Suppose John checks out `ProjectA` from the source code repository (say, GIT) to a local directory, 
`C:\projects\ProjectA` but Sam checks out the same project to a local directory `C:\projects\MyProject`. In addition, 
Amy checks out a _different_ project locally, also as `C:\projects\MyProject`.<br/> 

![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_00.png)<br/>

By default Nexial derives the project ID based on the directory name. So as shown above, in John's case, the project 
name would be `ProjectA` while both Sam's and Amy's would be `MyProject`. Whilst John and Sam are working on the 
same project and Amy on a different one, it would appear as if Sam and Amy are on the same project and John on 
another one. Such inconsistency can be further exasperated when one attempts to integrate these projects into a
large test.

To eliminate such issue, Nexial employs the concept of "metadata" so that all instances of the same project will be
regarded as the same in terms of project identification. Contained in this `.meta/project.id` is such project 
identification. Instead of deriving project ID based on the corresponding directory name, Nexial can identify the 
same via the `.meta/project.id` file - which is committed to the corresponding source code repository and 
subsequently checked out by project participants.<br/>

![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_00a.png)

To generate such file, one can create it manually, or use the [`nexial-project.[sh|cmd]`](BatchFiles#nexial-project) 
batch file. A a team, changes to this `.meta/project.id` file can be driven through consensus and propagated 
through source code repository (such as GIT).

When this `project.id` file is available, Nexial uses it to affix the output location when 
[`nexial.outputToCloud`](../systemvars/index#nexial.outputToCloud) is enabled. As such we can keep the output of the
same project in the same cloud storage location. Future effort will use this same `project.id` for further
enhancements such as execution output analysis, tracking and comparison.


## The `artifact/` directory
   The `artifact` directory contains 3 sub-directories: `data`, `plan`, `script`. These are the directories are used 
   to store test data, test plan and test scripts respectively.


### `artifact/bin/`
The `artifact/bin` directory contains custom batch files to execute a specific script or plan within the same
project. This directory is not required, but more of a recommendation. Using a batch file to execute your
script (or plan) helps to maintain consistency and simplify execution. This also helps to streamline the 
integration effort with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.


### `artifact/script/`
This directory will store your test scripts. The script files may be named to your likings. Generally the file 
name would reflect the overall functionality targeted for automation. Note that this is different than the naming 
recommendation for the worksheets within each test script. Each worksheet should reflect a test scenario, such as 
"User Login", "Search for Best Deal", "Import Client Data" and "Complete Order". The test script would a 
collection of related scenarios and thus be named like "Guest Access to AppX", "User Registration", and "Monthly 
Client Data Import".

Each sheet (test scenario) two sections: header (description of a test scenario) and body (test steps to automate). For 
better understanding about scenario and test steps of test scripts, script developer can provide information in 
`description` section of respective sections, as such test object and user acceptance criteria.

It is recommended that the [macro files](../commands/base/macro(file,sheet,name)) are stored in this location as well.


### `artifact/data/`
The `artifact/data` directory stores your test data. By default the data file is expected to be named in 
correspondent to the test script: `<TEST SCRIPT NAME>.data.xlsx`. But this convention can be overridden during 
execution via the `-data` flag to [`nexial.[cmd|sh]` script](BatchFiles#nexial). Similar to test scripts, each 
data file would contain one or many data sheets (worksheets) that correspond to the test scenarios. Again, this 
is the convention. Deviating from this convention can be attained via the `-datasheet` flag in 
[`nexial.[cmd|sh]`](BatchFiles#nexial). In general, other data files such as SQL, JSON, test data files (text) 
are stored in this location as well.


### `artifact/plan/`
The `artifact/plan` directory will store all the test plan. Each test plan may contain one or more test scripts 
and data files. It may contain test scripts and data files from a different project as well. For test artifacts 
of the same project, and the standard convention is followed, they can be referenced simply by the file name. In 
other words, test scripts are assumed to be found in `artifact/script` directory and data files are assumed to be 
found in `artifact/data` directory. One may use relative path, such as 
`../../AnotherProject/artifact/script/AnotherScript.xlsx`, to reference test artifacts of another project. 


### `artifact/project.properties`
The `artifact/project.properties` file (not shown above) is a "reserved" file designated to maintain project-wide 
data and configuration. With any automation project, there are various "scopes" of data. Some data is meant for a 
specific scenario - such should be stored within the datasheet (worksheet in data file) named after that scenario. 
Some data is meant to be used through an entire test script - such should be stored in the `#default` datasheet 
of the corresponding data file. Some data, however, is reusable across the entire project. Information such as 
database connectivity, application URL, commonly used locators, etc. can be stored in one place. This improves 
reuse and maintainability. This is the purpose of the `artifact/project.properties`.

Here are the rules about the `artifact/project.properties`:
1. It must be found under the project directory as `artifact/project.properties`. 
2. It is expected to be a file that contains the standard name-value pairs, as in `name1=value1`. Each pair is 
   separated by newline. 
3. It may contain custom data variables as well as Nexial system variables. 
4. Data variables defined in `project.properties` will override the same defined in a data file.

Let's have a look at `project.properties` file:<br/>
```properties
# You are reading the ".properties" entry.
! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.

# The key characters =, and : should be written with a preceding backslash to ensure that 
# they are properly loaded.
# However, there is no need to precede the value characters =, and : by a backslash.
key1 = value1
key2=Value2

# Backslash below tells the application to continue reading the value from the next line.
message = Welcome to \
          Nexial!

# Add spaces to the key
key=with spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key "key with spaces".

# If you want your property to include a backslash, escaped it by another backslash
path=c:\\wiki\\templates
```

class="external-link" target="_nexial_link">Properties file format</a>. 

##### Environment-specific `project.properties`
As of [Release v3.6](../release/nexial-core-v3.6.changelog), Nexial supports the concept of loading environment-specific
`project.properties` files. Inspired by the ever-popular Spring Framework, Nexial allows user to "stack" 2 distinct 
`project.properties` files via the runtime-defined data variable `nexial.env`. This would enable Nexial to first load
the data variables found in `project.properties`, and then load (and possibly override) the data variables found in
the environment-specific `project.properties` file, such as `project.QA.properties`. One can use the 
`JAVA_OPT=-Dnexial.env=...` or `-override nexial.env=...` technique on command line to specific a different 
`project.properties` via the following naming convention:

`nexial.${nexial.env}.properties`

For example,

(on Windows, using `JAVA_OPT=-Dnexial.env=...` technique):
```
cd %NEXIAL_HOME%\bin

set JAVA_OPT=-D... -Dnexial.env=QA ...

nexial.cmd -script %PROJECT_HOME%\artifact\script\... ...
```

The above instructs Nexial to load `artifact/project.properties` and then load **`artifact/project.QA.properties`**.

(or Mac/*NIX, using `-override` technique):
```
cd $PROJECT_HOME/bin

nexial.sh -script $PROJECT_HOME/artifact/script/... ... -override nexial.env=STAGING
```

The above instructs Nexial to load `artifact/project.properties` and then **`artifact/project.STAGING.properties`**.

Note that if the specified `nexial.env` cannot resolve to a readable file, Nexial will fallback to the default 
`project.properties` instead.

Using this `nexial.env` System variable, one can device 
[an effective strategy towards data management](./TargetedData-ProjectProperties) where environment-specific data 
variables can be separately managed while common, project-wide data variables remain centrally organized. 


### `output/`
The `output` directory contains the output of each test execution named as a `run id`, which is simply the timestamp 
of the start of an execution. The `captures` sub-directory stores all the screenshots and capture 
videos (if any). The `logs` directory stores all the log files, with the main log file named as 
`nexial-[START DATE/TIME].log`. The execution output file is named similarly to the corresponding test script:
`[TEST SCRIPT NAME].[START DATE/TIME].[ITERATION].xlsx`. It is generally a good idea to keep output separated by 
its execution. Hence the timestamp-based approach allows each execution its dedicated output directory. One can 
consider using the same output location to store any output files generated as part of the execution. See 
[`$(syspath|out|...)`](../functions/$(syspath)#available-functions) for more details.

When [`nexial.outputToCloud`](../systemvars/#nexial.outputToCloud) to set to `true`, the generated output will be
uploaded to designated cloud location and removed from local output directory.

1. The generated output file comes with a `#summary` sheet, wherein the execution summary for that iteration is 
   shown. Along with summary information, additional execution details are also available:
   1. `run from`: the host from which this execution was conducted.
   2. `run user`: the user of the operating system that performed the execution.
   3. `java version`: the version of Java (JRE or JDK) used for this execution.
   4. `nexial version`: the version of Nexial used for this execution.
   5. `Data File`: the data file (file name only) used for this execution.
   6. `DataSheet(s)`: the data sheets from which test data was retrieved during execution.
   7. `runtime args`: the command line argument used in this execution. Typically, this describes the information 
       entered after `nexial.cmd` or `nexial.sh`.
   8. `JAVA_OPT`: additional runtime System properties (i.e. `-D...`) configured for this execution. Here's a sample 
      output file to illustrate the same:<br/>
      ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_03.png)
      Additional entries, such as AUT version, test cycle, can be added here via the 
      [`nexial.scriptRef.*`](../systemvars/index.html#nexial.scriptRef) data variables.<br/>
2. The `#summary` sheet also includes with consolidated test summary, such as duration per activity and total steps
   passed and failed.<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_04.png)<br/><br/>
3. Nexial supports data variable substitution in the description section of each test scenario to contextualize 
   information particular to the execution conducted. This will help its readers to differentiate the different 
   output for the same script. For example, suppose we have the following data file and test script:<br/>
   Data File:<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_05.png)<br/>
   Test Script/Scenario:<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_06.png)<br/>
   Output File:<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_07.png)<br/><br/>
4. Nexial also produces another output at the end of execution to provide summary level of 
   execution report, a drill-down chart as well as extrapolation across test plans, 
   test scripts, iterations, scenarios, and activities:<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_08.png)<br/><br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_08_1.png)<br/><br/>

   The drill-down chart by default provides the results at the **Execution level**. The graph displays various contents
   as follows:-
   <ul>
      <li>Failed steps Count</li>
      <li>Passed steps Count</li>
      <li>Total steps Count</li>
      <li>Skipped steps Count</li>
      <li>Pass percentage of the steps</li>
      <li>Duration it took to execute steps at a specific level. This is calculated in terms of minutes.</li>
   </ul>
   <br/>

   Consider the following graph which shows the results at the **Execution Level**:<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_drilldown_1.png)<br/><br/>

   User can drill down further by clicking on the **bar** or the **points** in the chart. For example user can click the
   bar corresponding to the **total steps** or the point corresponding to **duration** to drill down further to the 
   next level.
  
   User can drill down to the lower levels in the order **Plan** -> **Script** -> **Iteration** ->
   **Scenario** as shown in the below 
   screenshots: <br/>

   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_drilldown_2.png)<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_drilldown_3.png)<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_drilldown_4.png)<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_drilldown_5.png)<br/>

   User can use the **back** button to go to the upper level and similarly use **Execution** button to go to 
   the Execution level.
   
5. As of Nexial [v4.3](../release/nexial-core-v4.3.changelog), this execution summary report also generate video 
   playback for any generated [desktop recordings](../commands/base/startRecording()) and 
   [web service logs](../systemvars/index.html#nexial.ws.logSummary). For example, below is a snippet of the screen
   recording generated during execution. One may use the recording for further post-execution analysis.<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_12.png)<br/>

   Below shows an interactive grid for all the web service calls invoked during an execution. One can sort and filter 
   this grid to better understand the performance and characteristics of the target application in terms of API calls.
   Note that [`nexial.ws.logSummary`](../systemvars/index.html#nexial.ws.logSummary) and 
   [`nexial.ws.logDetail`](../systemvars/index.html#nexial.ws.logDetail) must be turned on (set to `true`) in order for
   this to work:
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_13.png)<br/>

   Besides the interactive web service summary grid, Nexial also catalog all the web service calls (see below) so that 
   one can differentiate them and view the request/response detail of each invocation.<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_14.png)<br/>
   
   The Execution Summary file is always generated in the output directory as `execution-output.html`. It provides summary 
   data at multiple levels and links to the execution output file. Some amount of interactivity is available where
   one can toggle the visibility of script, iteration, scenarios and activities data. See 
   [Improving your execution summary report](ImprovingExecutionReport) for more details.<br/><br/>
6. <a name="junit"></a>Along with the above-stated output, Nexial also produces a JUNIT compatible xml file. This
   XML file is always generated in the output directory as `junit.xml`. This file is useful when integrating with
   JUNIT-compatible tools and plugins such as:<br/>

   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_10.png)<br/>
   ![](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_11.png)<br/>


### Additional Notes
For convenience, use the `bin/nexial-project.cmd` or `bin/nexial-project.sh` to generate the project structure for 
you. See [`nexial-project.[cmd|sh]`](BatchFiles#nexial-project) for more details.

As a convention, it is recommended to use `C:\projects` or `/Users/<username/projects` (MacOSX/Linux) as the top-level 
directory for all your Nexial projects.

#### Adding new test artifact
Nexial is distributed with a set of empty, ready-to-use templates for your automation. Navigate to 
`${NEXIAL_HOME}/template` directory, and you should see the available templates:<br/>

![nexial_home](image/UnderstandingProjectStructure_02.png)

This template directory contains a few files – templates to get you starting a new test automation effort.  Let's have 
a closer look:

The `template/` directory contains 4 files:
- **nexial-data.xlsx**: contains formatting rules to help differentiate between Nexial-specific data element and 
  application-specific / custom data element.  Technically one wouldn't need this template per se.  But it is 
  recommended to use this template for your new data file for consistency's sake.
- **nexial-macro.xlsx**: contains the basic template of a Nexial macro script (reusable steps).  See 
  [base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](../commands/base/macro(file,sheet,name)) for more details about macros.
- **nexial-script.xlsx**: the basic template of a test script.
- **nexial-testplan.xlsx**: the basic template of a test plan.

Generally speaking, it is recommended to use the [`nexial-project`](BatchFiles#nexial-project) batch file to add new 
artifact. This batch file provides a number of fail-safe automation that keep your project more manageable. However,
if you prefer, you may copy any of these "template" artifacts into your project. If you copy one of these templates to 
your project directory, remember to (1) place it in the designated location (`script/` for scripts, `data/` for data, 
etc.), and (2) rename according to [convention](#nexial-project-structure).

Lastly, the templates are shipped with each build.  They contain the latest set of commands available in each build.
