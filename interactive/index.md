## Introduction
While we strive to create an intuitive and empowering platform for automation, Nexial might still seem challenging for 
the uninitiated. Those unfamiliar with automation or software testing, the idea of designing "steps" to "break" a 
software system might seem awkward at first. However, after a few tries, one could quickly grasp the core concept and 
gain momentum. As the saying goes, _practice makes perfect_. It is through repeated practices, in fact through failure, 
that one truly learns.

This is the initial impetus of **Nexial Interactive**. The idea is to provide an environment where one learns about 
Nexial and automation at a more consumable and effective pace. One can use Nexial Interactive to step through one 
or more commands repeatedly, each time with possibly different parametrization. The try-observe-repeat cycle 
through Nexial Interactive hopefully fosters a more engaging and intuitive way to:
- learn Nexial
- learn about automation
- learn about the target application (AUT)
- learn about an existing automation script/suite


### Capabilities
Currently Nexial Interactive comes with the following capabilities:
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('assign_script_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)assign</a> and 
  <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('reload_script_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)load test script</a>
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('assign_data_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)assign</a> and 
  <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('reload_data_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)load data file</a>
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('assign_scenario_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)assign test scenario</a>
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('assign_activity_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)assign activities</a>; 
  may be out of designated sequence
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('assign_step_tab','options-and-actions')">(re)assign steps</a>; 
  may be out of designated sequence
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('inspection_tab','actions')">Inspection</a>
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('execute_tab','options-and-actions')">execute</a> the assigned 
  activities or steps
- <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('recoding_tab','options-and-actions')">record</a> current 
  Interactive session

Note that the main objective of Nexial Interactive is to execute a subset of the automation script, perhaps repeatedly,
so that we can better understand the target application, the automation objective, or the capability of Nexial. As such, 
Nexial Interactive does not support test plan or multiple scenarios. The common usage pattern is to focus on a block 
of steps (of one scenario, naturally), work through the __"execute-observe-repeat"__ cycle, and move on to the next 
block of steps. One can assign or reassign the number of steps or scenario between execution. 


### Try it yourself
To activate Nexial Interactive, simply add the `-interactive` flag to your Nexial execution command line argument. If 
needed, one may include `-scenario ...` and `-data ...` command line arguments as well.<br/>

nexial.cmd -script C:\projects\MyProject\artifact\script\MyTestScript1.xlsx <b style="color:red">-interactive</b></pre>
        </div>
        <div id="tab2" class="tab" style= "display:none;">
        From a terminal session, start a Nexial execution as you normally would, but also add a <code>-interactive</code>
        flag at the end:
        <pre>cd ~/projects/nexial-core/bin
nexial.sh -script ~/projects/MyProject/artifact/script/MyTestScript1.xlsx <b style="color:red">-interactive</b></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

If all goes well, a console-based menu (see below) will appear.<br/>
![](image/ni_main_menu.png)

This represents an active Nexial Interactive session. The top half of the menu shows the current configuration: the 
assigned script, the assigned scenario and the assigned activities/steps to 
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('execute_tab','options-and-actions')">execute</a>. The second half 
are the available options and actions to control the current Nexial Interactive session - these options and actions are 
represented by the characters highlighted with white background. They can be activated by typing the corresponding 
letter or number at the "`command:`" prompt. Click one of the tabs below to see more details about these options and 
actions.

            All Nexial execution contains at least 1 iteration. The first iteration is loaded by default. To utilize the
            data of another iteration, we can use this option to load and override existing data variables. The effect
            and usefulness of this is similar to that of assigning a different data file (Option 2), where one can

            To load the data from Iteration 3, enter <code>4 3</code>. After that, we can see that the same data

            Using this option, one can alter the intended order of execution as laid out within a scenario. One can
            skip over or re-run certain activity, or alter the order of execution amongst the activities of a scenario.
            Much like the purpose of other options in Nexial Interactive, this option allows one to explore the behavior

            <span class="how-title">Here's how</span> From the <code>command:</code> prompt, enter <code>5</code> then
            either the name of the activity to execute, or its "index". For multiple activities, one may also specify 
            a list of activities as a range. For example, <code>2-5</code> means the second activity through the fifth 
            activity. We can also use <code>2,3,4,5</code> to reach the effect. Let's see this in action via the 
            following example:<br/>

            We can see (screenshot below) that the 2 activities are properly recognized and displayed in the Nexial
            Interactive menu. To <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('execute_tab','options-and-actions')">execute</a> 
            just the first activity - "Open Example Site", enter <code>5 Open Example Site</code>. We can reload the 
            menu (<code>r</code>) to verify that the activity list has been updated: <br/>
            <img src="image/ni_activity_1.png"/><br/>
            We can also switch the order of the activities. Below we are using the "index" instead of the activity 
            names:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_activity_2.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Note that this option only changes the activity or activities to execute. To commence the

            <code>5-9</code> - or as individual steps such as <code>5,9,12,6,8,8</code>. Let's see this in action via

            all the steps via the activities found in the current scenario. To change to execute Step 8 through Step 12,

            Use <code>C</code> to toggle desktop recording during current Nexial Interactive session<br/>
            <br/>
            Nexial Interactive gives one the flexibility to alter execution sequence and data, and to try out 
            different ways of interacting with the target application and with Nexial. As such, it may be beneficial to 
            record the various executions, along with the changes, the try-outs, the back-and-forth. One can use such 
            record to retrace the steps that uncover a defect or complete a previously failed scenario.<br/>
            <br/>
            This is the main purpose of this feature. One can enter <code>C</code> to toggle the start and stop of
            desktop recording, and then utility the recording later for investigative purpose. Note that the desktop 
            recording is only effective on the "Primary Monitor" - otherwise known as "Screen 1". It would be a good
            habit to always 
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('execute_tab','options-and-actions')">execute</a> one's 
            automation on the primary monitor. Let's see this in action:<br/>
            <br/>
            To start the desktop recording, enter <code>c</code>:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_recording_start.png"/><br/>
            Now we can proceed with the automation. We can also use 
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('inspection_tab','options-and-actions')">Inspection</a> 
            or any features of Nexial Interactive. As long as the actions carried out is visible on the primary monitor, 
            these actions will be recorded:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_recording_execution.png"/><br/>
            Finally we can enter <code>c</code> again to end the recording. Notice that the recorded video file (mp4) is
            displayed on the console. Nexial Interactive prompts us with 3 choices:<ol>
            <li><code>P</code> to play this video,</li>
            <li><code>S</code> to show the video file in the file manager, and</li> 
            <li><code>D</code> to delete it</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="image/ni_recording_stop.png"/><br/>
            As an example, when we enter <code>s</code>, the video file in question is displayed:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_recording_file.png"/><br/>
        </div>
        <div id="tab14" class="tab">
            Use <code>R</code> to refresh Interactive Interactive menu.<br/>
            <br/>
            After reassigning script, data file, scenario, iteration, activity or step, it's usually a good idea
            to re-render the Nexial Interactive console menu again. In doing so, Nexial Interactive will display the 
            script, scenario, activity or steps that are designated to 
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrollToTab('execution_tab','options-and-actions')">execute</a>. For
            example, see below and notice the change in Activity between the Refresh menu option being 
            activated:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_activity_1.png"/><br/>
        </div>
        <div id="tab15" class="tab">
            Use <code>X</code> to execute the assigned activities or steps.<br/>
            <br/>
            The automation runs as one would expect via the non-interactive (normal) Nexial execution, except that the 
            execution steps might be different. As expected, the execution log will be displayed on the console as well.
            At the end of execution, Nexial Interactive will display a summary of the execution, like this:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_execute_output.png"/><br/>
            It is noteworthy to clarify that execution under Nexial Interactive will <b>NOT</b> generate the execution 
            output or summary files. Due to its interactive nature, any generated output files/reports wouldn't be 
            meaningful.

        <div id="tab16" class="tab">
            Use <code>I</code> to enter into Inspection.<br/>
            <br/>
            One can also activate Inspection (similar to <a href="../systemvars/index#nexial.inspectOnPause">
            <code>nexial.inspectOnPause</code></a> to analyze and learn about data variables, 
            <a href="../functions">built-in functions</a>, and <a href="../expressions">Nexial expressions]</a>. 
            Its ability to expose data variables post-execution makes it a helpful tool for root cause analysis. One can
            also use Inspection to learn or analysis complex expression, <a href="../jsonpath">JSONPath</a>, built-in
            functions, etc.<br/>
            <br/>
            To show the current value of a data variable, use the <code>${...}</code> syntax. To execute a built-in 
            function, use its <code>$(...)</code> syntax. For expression, the defined <code>[DATA-TYPE(...) => ... ... ]</code>
            syntax is expected. See below for some examples:<br/>
            <img src="image/ni_inspect.png"/><br/>
            Furthermore, one may create, modify or clear data variables on-the-fly in Inspection.
            <li>The <code>SAVE(var)</code> syntax allows one to create or override a data variable. The value of such 
            data variable may be literal or derived from built-in functions or Nexial Expression.</li>
            <li>The <code>CLEAR(var1,var2,...)</code> syntax allows one to clear one or more data variables, except 
            those that are read-only or defined in the command line <code>-override</code> flag.</li>
            <li>The <code>CLEAR(*)</code> syntax is a special case of <code>CLEAR(var1,var2,...)</code>. Its purpose is
            to clear off all user-defined data variables except defined on command line (via <code>-override</code> flag) 
            and those defined in project.properties.</li>
            Below are a few examples:<br/><pre>
> inspect: SAVE(myData) = [LIST(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) => sum]
11:15:15.786 >> LIST    => sum                   NUMBER(55)
11:15:15.787 >> creating data variable [a] to [55]<br/>
> inspect: CLEAR(b,a,nexial.runID)
11:14:27.730 >> removing data variable [b, a, nexial.runID]
11:14:27.731 >> The following data variable(s) are READ ONLY and ignored: nexial.runID
11:14:27.731 >> The following data variable(s) are removed from execution: a<br/>
> inspect: CLEAR(*)
11:14:27.730 >> removing data variable [*]
11:14:27.731 >> The following data variable(s) are removed from execution:
11:14:27.731 >>     data1
11:14:27.731 >>     password
11:14:27.731 >>     target_url </pre>
            Starting with <a href="../release/nexial-core-v3.7.changelog">Nexial v3.7</a>, Inspect in Nexial Interactive
            supports <a href="../commands/desktop">Desktop Automation</a> as well. Here are the possible inspection 
            features for Desktop Automation:<br/>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath)</code> - inspect a desktop element based on XPATH</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label)</code> - inspect a desktop element based on a label in the current form</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath) => click</code> - click on a desktop element based on XPATH</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label) => click</code> - click on a desktop element based a label in the current form</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath) => doubleClick</code> - double click on a desktop element based on XPATH</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label) => doubleClick</code> - double click on a desktop element based on a label in 
                the current form</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath) => type(input)</code> - type the specified input on a desktop element based on 
                XPATH</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label) => type(input)</code> - type the specified input on a desktop element based a 
                label in the current form</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath) => context(menu,menu,...)</code> - simulate the activation of context menu (i.e. 
                right-click) on a desktop element based on XPATH, follow by the activation of such context menu via 
                the `menu` input. For sub-menu, use comma (<code>,</code>) to specify multi-level of sub-menu to 
                activate.</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label) => context(menu,menu,...)</code> - simulate the activation of context menu (i.e. 
                right-click) on a desktop element based on a label in the current form, follow by the activation of 
                such context menu via the <code>label</code> parameter(s). For sub-menu, use comma (<code>,</code>) to 
                specify multi-level of sub-menu to activate.</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(xpath) => menu(label,label,...)</code> - simulate the activation of the application menu 
                on an application window based on XPATH, follow by the activation of the sub-menu(s) items. Each level 
                of sub-menu items are separated by comma (<code>,</code>). Note that the specified XPATH must resolved 
                to the "owning" window of the target application menu.</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(label) => menu(label,label,...)</code> - simulate the activation of the application menu 
                of an application window based its "autoscan" label, follow by the activation of the sub-menu(s) items. 
                Each level of sub-menu items are separated by comma (<code>,</code>). Note that the specified label 
                must resolved to the "owning" window of the target application menu.</li>
            <li><code>DESKTOP(app) => menu(label,label,...)</code> - click on one or more application menu items on the 
                current form. This is effectively the same as <code>DESKTOP(label) => menu(label,label,...)</code></li>

            Use <code>T</code> to purge Nexial-generated temp files that are generated during automation.<br/>
            <br/>
            During execution, Nexial generates temp files as the transient execution result. Generally speaking, these 
            temp files are purged after some time. However, one can use this option purge these temp files immediately 
            to reclaim needed disk space or if excessive temp files is a performance concern. Note that as a safety
            precaution, this command will only clear out files that are generated more than an hour ago.

### Limitation
As time permits and as requests are made, further enhancements to Nexial Interactive will be implemented. Currently, 
here are the enhancement candidates that we are considering for future version of Nexial Interactive. No timeline has 
been committed as yet.
- Desktop GUI version of Nexial Interactive
- Switching between interactive and non-interactive (normal execution) mode
- Switch browser; currently some System variables cannot be adjusted within the same Nexial Interactive session
- Remembering last-run Nexial Interactive session to improve efficiency.

Also, please note the following limitations:
- The console scrollback limited by the console application (Command console for Windows and terminal for MacOSX). 
  Please check the documentation of the respective console application on how to extend the scrollback limits.
- Cannot run steps in parallel.
- Nexial Interactive is not a true debugging environment. Yes, it can be an effective learning tool. But it is not - 
  and probably never will be - equivalent to a true debugger like those modern-day IDEs.
