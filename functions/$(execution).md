### Description
This built-in function expose the execution-level metadata, both the runtime and design-time information.


### Available Functions

#### `$(execution|step|index)`
Display the row number of the step currently in execution

**Example**<br/>
{% include_relative example_execution.md  %}. In this example, we use this function in combination with email 
notification to expose the step that had failed during execution.
