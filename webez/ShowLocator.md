## Introduction
Show Locator is another feature of Nexial WebEZ designed to assist in generating meaningful locators for the current
web page. One can use this feature from within a web page at any time (after Nexial WebEZ is installed) - even if 
WebEZ is not currently performing inspection.

To demonstrate how Show Locator works, watch this short demo below:
