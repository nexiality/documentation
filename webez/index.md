## Introduction

> ##### TL;DR For the impatient, scroll down to [WebEZ in Action](#webez-in-action) to see a short demo!

**Nexial WebEZ** [`/ wɛb ˈi zi /`] is a Chrome browser extension designed to expedite Web automation, especially (but 
not limited to) with the use of [Nexial Automation](/index.html). The main objectives of this tool are:
- To speed up the tasks of associating Web elements to a [Web commands](../commands/web/index.html#available-commands),
- To easily create (and edit) a basic Nexial-based, Web automation script for the purpose of Web automation,
- To learn about Web automation,
- To learn about Nexial Automation Platform,
- To learn about the Web application you are targeting for automation

It is, however, **NOT**:
- a record-and-playback application. _They

  <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3077286/record-playback-automation-its-a-trap.html" class="external-link" target="_nexial_link">here</a>) 
- a debugger or web page profiler. Profiler is an important part of web page performance analysis. Nexial provides
  [some capabilities around this](../commands/web/index.html#browser-performance-metrics). Lighthouse is another great 
  tool in this space.
- a full-fledged script editor.

With Nexial WebEZ, one can create a "Web automation ready" script in a reasonably short amount of time. With less time 
spent on figuring out locators and the commands to use, one can focus on Testing and Quality-related concerns.
This aligns well to the mission of [Nexial Automation](/index.html), which is to accelerate Testing and the advancement 
of Quality Engineering. 

So what does this Nexial WebEZ look like? Let's have a look!
