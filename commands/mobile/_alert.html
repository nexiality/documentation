    <h4><b>Regarding Alert Dialog</b></h4>
    Typically, an alert dialog requires immediate attention. It will block (as a modal component) all user interactions
    until it is dismissed. Hence, it is critical that we consider such condition as part of the automation. However,
    it is possible to automatically dismiss (or accept) alert dialog during automation, instead of explicitly checking
    for its presence and dismissing it. To do so, add the following configuration to the corresponding profile:<br/>
    <br/>
    <h5><b>Automatically accept alerts (iOS only)</b></h5>
    <code>[profile].autoAcceptAlerts=true</code><br/>
    Accept all iOS alerts automatically if they pop up. This includes privacy access permission alerts (e.g., location,
    contacts, photos). Default is `false`.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h5><b>Automatically dismiss alerts (iOS only)</b></h5>
    <code>[profile].autoDismissAlerts=true</code><br/>
    Dismiss all iOS alerts automatically if they pop up. This includes privacy access permission alerts (e.g., location,
    contacts, photos). Default is `false`.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h5><b>Android support</b></h5>
    Unfortunately, alert dialog support on Android is still lacking due to underlying driver implementation. However,
    for the alert dialog related to granting application permissions (during app installation), these alerts can be
    eliminated via the <code>autoGrantPermissions</code> configuration. Note that another configuration -
    <code>noReset</code> - must NOT be set to `true` in order for this to work. For example,<br/>
    <code>[profile].autoGrantPermissions=true</code><br/>
    <code>[profile].noReset=false</code><br/>
</div>
