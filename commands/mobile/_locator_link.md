#### About locators
Note that for mobile automation, there are some differences in locators between Android and iOS devices. Check the 
the [Locator](index.html#locators) section for the various options of specifying a locator. Unless there are strong
justification such as performance lag or platform-specific workaround, the recommendation is to use locators that are 
common to all mobile devices -- namely, ID (`id=...`), Accessibility ID (`a11y=...`) or XPATH (`xpath=...`).
