            Quick Tip: ID locators are prefixed by <code>id=</code><br/>
            <br/>
            Reference an element by its ID is, by far, the simplest type of locator. Unfortunately, just like its web
            counterpart, the "ID" in reference isn't always unique as one would hope. For simpler application this
            locator usually works well. For more complex applications where an "ID" might be repeated across multiple
            elements, a different locator strategy (such as XPATH) might be a better way to go.<br/>
            <br/>
            For Android application, the "resource-id" property is also considered as an "ID". One can use either the
            <code>id=...</code> or <code>res=...</code> syntax. Here's an example of finding a "ID" of a element via the
            Appium inspector:<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_01.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            For the above example, one may express this locator as:
            <ul>
                <li><code>id=com.google.android.calculator:id/digit_5</code></li>
                <li><code>res=com.google.android.calculator:id/digit_5</code></li>
            </ul>
            In contrast, iOS automation uses the "name" property as the "ID". Note that there isn't an actual property
            named as "ID" or "id". However, one may use either <code>id=...</code> or <code>name=...</code> syntax.
            Nexial will appropriately resolve it to the correct type of locator.<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_02.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            For the above example, one may express this locator as:
            <ul>
                <li><code>id=Remind me on a day</code></li>
                <li><code>name=Remind me on a day</code></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="tab_a11y" class="tab">
            Quick Tip: Accessibility ID locators are prefixed by <code>a11y=</code><br/>
            <br/>
            The design purpose of an accessibility ID is to improve usability for users with visual or hearing
            impairment. Accessibility tools like screen readers or TTS software utilize these IDs to provide additional
            usability support. From the test automation standpoint, the same accessibility ID can be utilized as the
            basis of identifying an element. As a convenience, Nexial recognizes a locator by accessibility ID via the
            <code>a11y</code> prefix (there are 11 characters between <code>a</code> and <code>y</code> of
            <code>accessibility</code>).<br/>
            <br/>
            On Android, this locator strategy uses <code>contentDescription</code> or <code>content-desc</code>
            property:<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_03.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            For the above example, the locator would be <code>a11y=Dark theme</code>.<br/>
            <br/>
            On iOS, the accessibility id, the id, and the name locator strategies are all identical. Behind the scene,
            they are implemented the same way.<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_04.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            For the above example, one would specify this locator as <code>a11y=Back</code>.<br/>
            <br/>
            Generally speaking, it is preferred to use the accessibility ID over ID (although on iOS they are the same)
            because the accessibility ID is:
            <ol>
                <li>beneficial to both testers and users with visual or hearing impairment.</li>
                <li>generally more readable than plain ID.</li>
            </ol>

        <div id="tab_xpath" class="tab">
            Quick Tip: XPATH locators are prefixed by <code>xpath=</code> or without any prefixes.<br/>
            <br/>
            The tried and true XPATH locator is available for mobile automation, as in the case of web or desktop
            automation. And as it is in the case of other automation uses, XPATH is both powerful and potentially
            troublesome.<br/>
            <br/>
            With XPATH, one can search for an element via its hierarchy, its attributes and its text. Whereas the power
            lies, so is the danger thereof (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility" class="external-link"
               target="_nexial_link">Peter Parker principle</a>).<br/>
            <br/>
            It is often prudent <b>NOT</b> to use the XPATH locator provided by Appium inspector. Instead, one should
            put some effort to simplifying it. For example,<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_05.png"/><br/>
            <br/>
            The provided/suggested XPATH for the "Connected devices" link is as follows (broken into lines for
            readability):
            <pre>/hierarchy/android.widget.FrameLayout
  /android.widget.LinearLayout
    /android.widget.FrameLayout
      /android.view.ViewGroup
        /android.widget.ScrollView
          /android.widget.LinearLayout
            /android.widget.FrameLayout[2]
              /android.widget.LinearLayout
                /android.widget.FrameLayout
                  /androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
                    /android.widget.LinearLayout[2]
                      /android.widget.RelativeLayout
                        /android.widget.TextView[1]</pre>
            Surely this would work (since Appium provides this). It is also incredibly difficult to decipher and to
            maintain. Instead, one could reduce this to something like:
            <ul>
                <li><code>//android.widget.TextView[@text='Connected devices']</code></li>
                <li><code>//*[@text='Connected devices']</code></li>
            </ul>
            The benefits of optimizing the XPATH are:
            <ol>
                <li>Easier to read, hence easier to maintain</li>
                <li>No long dependent on the hierarchy or placements of UI elements</li>
                <li>Potentially faster than the long-winded version</li>
            </ol>
            To use XPATH locator in Nexial, simply use the XPATH as is or prefix it with <code>xpath=</code>.

            Quick Tip: Text locators are prefixed by <code>text=</code><br/>
            <br/>
            This is a Nexial-only addition to the world of locators. The central idea here is to simplify automation
            by providing a simple way to reference an element that contains a unique string of text within the current
            application screen. For example,
            <pre>text=Enter your first name here</pre>
            ... references an element that contains an attribute named <code>text</code> with the value of
            <code>Enter your first name here</code>.<br/>
            <br/>
            In situations where one needs to automate a form on a mobile app, this type of locator might prove to be
            most useful. It is both easy to use and to decipher. This form of locator also supports PolyMatcher, which
            provides further expressiveness and flexibility. For example,
            <pre>text=START:Welcome home</pre>
            For more details on PolyMatcher, visit
            <a href="assertTextPresent(locator,text)"><code>assertTextPresent(locator,text)</code></a> and click on
            "PolyMatcher Enabled" link.<br/>
            <br/>
            Note that behind the scene, Nexial convert such locator to a XPATH-based locator.

            Quick Tip: Predicate locators are prefixed by <code>predicate=</code><br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Only applicable for iOS automation</b>. Also known as <code>-ios predicate string</code>. This type
            of locator represents a recursive element search using the iOS Predicate (iOS 10.0 and above). The syntax
            is similar to XPATH query but comes with its own set of logical and comparative operators. While this type
            of locator is powerful, one would essentially be writing another "mini" query language. Consult the
            following links for more details:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-predicate/">http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-predicate/</a></li>

            </ul>
            Since this only works on iOS and has dependency on the underlying iOS object model, this form of
            identifying elements should not be considered as the first choice. Nonetheless, at times the iOS-specific
            technique might be the only viable option.<br/>
            <br/>
            For this type of locator, prefix it with <code>predicate=</code>.

        <div id="tab_cc" class="tab">
            Quick Tip: Class Chain locators are prefixed by <code>cc=</code><br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Only applicable for iOS automation</b>. This type of locator strategy is designed to replace XPATH
            (albeit only available on iOS platform) to quickly locate hierarchical elements. It is possible to use class
            chain (from this point, <code>cc</code>) to search for direct child element using <code>/</code> or
            search for descendent elements using <code>**/</code> syntax. Filter criteria should be enclosed within
            back tick (<code>`...`</code>) for matching predicate, and enclosed within dollar (<code>$...$</code>) for
            containing predicates. For example, the following XPATH:<br/>
            <pre>//XCUIElementTypeTable[@name="table"]/XCUIElementTypeCell[@visible="true" and .//XCUIElementTypeTextField[@name="input]]</pre>
            ... would be translated into <cod>cc</cod> locator like this:<br/>
            <pre>

            While not necessarily less verbose than its XPATH counterpart, <code>cc</code> locator promised to be more
            performant without losing much of the flexibility found in XPATH. Here are a few more examples,<br>
            <ul>
                <li><code>XCUIElementTypeWindow[2]</code> - selects the second window in the hierarchy.</li>
                <li><code>XCUIElementTypeWindow[label BEGINSWITH “foo”][-1]</code> - selects the last window whose
                    label begins with <code>foo</code>.
                </li>
                <li><code>**/XCUIElementTypeCell[name BEGINSWITH "C"]/XCUIElementTypeButton[10]</code> - selects the
                    10th child button of the first cell in the tree whose name starts with <code>C</code> and which
                    has at least ten direct children of type <code>XCUIElementTypeButton</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            One may use Appium inspector to find a suitable <code>cc</code> locator for a iOS device.<br/>

        <div id="tab_nearby" class="tab">
            This is a specialized locator (<i>only in Nexial!</i>) aimed to simplify the task of creating a locator.
            Instead of identifying an element via its attributes such as <code>content-desc</code>, <code>id</code> or
            <code>accessibility id</code>, the <code>nearby</code> locator allows one to identify an element by its
            surrounding. While this technique does not yield the same benefit in every scenario, it can be a great
            time saver.<br/><br/>
            Let's consider the following example,<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_06.png"/><br/>
            To identity the text box, we would need to inspect its attributes (typically via Appium Inspector). With
            the <code>nearby</code> locator, we can simply specify it as: <code>nearby={below:Cellphone}</code><br/>
            (reads: <i>Locate the element that is immediately below the element with text <code>Cellphone</code></i>)<br/>
            <br/>
            Here's another example,<br/>
            <img src="image/locator_07.png"><br/>
            To identify the "Male" radio button, we can specify the locator as <code>nearby={left-of:Male}</code>.<br/>
            <br/>
            Since these elements (in the examples above) do not have any visible text, one would need to construct a
            suitable locator via other attributes via Appium Inspector (or equivalent). With this <code>nearby</code>
            locator, we can simply use the "visible" surrounding of the element instead. In many cases, not only is such
            locator much easier to construct, but they are also much more readable and maintainable.<br/>
            <br/>
            Here's the syntax of this <code>nearby</code> locator:<br/>
            <pre>nearby={[relative-to]:[visible-text]},{attribute=value,attribute=value,...}</pre>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>[relative-to]</code>: one of these values: <code>left-of</code>, <code>right-of</code>,
                    <code>above</code>, <code>below</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>[visible-text]: the text that is visible, which is used to identify the target element</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>{attribute=value,attribute=value,...}</code>: OPTIONAL. One can supply additional attributes
                    of the target element to improve the locator precision. This is generally not needed. At times when
                    there are many elements nearby the same text element, one may want to consider adding additional
                    attributes to filter out the conflicting elements.
