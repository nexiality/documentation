This command automates the selection of `OPTION` element(s) from a `SELECT` element identified via `locator`. The
target `OPTION` element is identified via `text`, which could be plain text for single element identification (i.e. 
exact match) or regex-based element identification (i.e. multi-match). For example, suppose the following `SELECT` 
element:

![](image/select_03.png)

To select "American flamingo", one would specify `text` as `American flamingo`. However, one can also specify `text` as
`REGEX:American.+` (reads: _starts with "American"_).  Similarly, to select "Lesser flamingo", one can specify `text`
as `REGEX:Lesser.+`.

Now suppose we have a `SELECT` element that suppose multi-select:

To select both "Andean flamingo" and "Chilean flamingo", one would specify `text` as `REGEX:.+ean .+` 
(reads: _contains "ean "_).

#### Supporting index-based selection
As of [v4.4](../../release/nexial-core-v4.4.changelog), Nexial supports the selection of a `OPTION` element using its 
index. To do so, specify the `text` parameter in the form of `INDEX:[number]`. Note that the specified index is assumed 
to be 0-based. A special case of `INDEX:last` is also supported to select the last `OPTION` element. For example, 
`INDEX:1` would select the second `OPTION` element belonging to the target `SELECT` element, while `INDEX:last` would 
select the last `OPTION` element instead.


#### Note
- If multiple matches are found through regex-based identification but the target `SELECT` element only support single 
  selection, then only the first one will be selected.
- If the regex-based identification yielded no matches, then `text` will be retried as exact match. This means Nexial
  will look for a `OPTION` element under the target `SELECT` element that contains the text `REGEX:...`.
- The `REGEX:` capability works for both [`select(locator,text)`](select(locator,text)) and 
  [`deselect(locator,text)`](deselect(locator,text)) command.
- If `text` is `{ALL}` and the target `SELECT` element supports **multi-select**, then **ALL** its `OPTION` elements 
  will be **selected.**


### Parameters
- **locator** - the locator of the `SELECT` element.
- **text** - the text to be selected on the `SELECT` element. As said earlier, it supports `Regex:` capability 
            as well as `{ALL}` to select all options.
