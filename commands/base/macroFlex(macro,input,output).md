### Description
The main idea with this command is to extend the existing **[base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](macro(file,sheet,name))**
command, where a series of ephemeral (temporal, _more on this below_) input and output data can be specified per 
invocation. 

The existing **[base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](macro(file,sheet,name))** command works well in terms of 
reusability. One can utilize the same macro in multiple scripts to automate a series of steps uniformly. With the 
ability to add [flow controls](../../flowcontrols), [`section`](section(steps)) and 
[repeat-until](repeatUntil(steps,maxWaitMs)), a macro provides a reasonably sound approach to capturing and reusing 
repeating steps. For more details about macros, please visit **[base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](macro(file,sheet,name))**. 

However, the design of macro comes with a few different constraints that might hinder flexibility and 
maintainability:
1. The data variables used by a macro must be correctly defined prior to invocation.
2. The data variables created or modified by a macro could possibly conflict (and override) with its calling script.
3. A macro might modify one or more System variables, which could adversely impact the rest of the execution.
4. So, the data variables created or modified by a macro will not be accessible after completion of macro.

Such are the initial impetus to creating `macroFlex`. The main idea is to isolate a set of data variables, assigned as 
"inputs", to a macro and to extract a set of "outputs" produced by the same macro into data variables -- with minimum
disruption to the calling script and other test artifacts during execution. Consider the following simple example:

##### Macro (macro1)

|cmd type|command                |param 1             |param 2  |param 3|
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------|-------|
|`number`|`increment(var,amount)`|`num1`              |`${num2}`|       |
|`base`  |`verbose(text)`        |`The sum is ${num1}`|         |       |

<br/>

##### Script

|cmd type|command                            |param 1          |param 2  |param 3|
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|---------|-------|
|`base`  |`save(var,value)`                  |`num1`           |`37`     |       |
|`base`  |`save(var,value)`                  |`num2`           |`5`      |       |
|`base`  |**`macroFlex(macro,input,output)`**|${macro}         |**`num1=${num1}`<br/>`num2=${num2}`**|**`num1=total`**|
|`base`  |`verbose(text)`                    |`${num1} + ${num2} = ${total}`       |                |       |

Th macro `macro1` is invoked from the script (line 3) via the `macroFlex` command. Looking at the macro, it is no 
different than any other Nexial macros (hence it is also usable via [base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](macro(file,sheet,name))).
Notice that the data variable `num1` is modified within the macro via the 
[number &raquo; `increment(var,amount)`](../number/increment(var,amount)) command. If one is invoking this macro via the 
[base &raquo; `macro(file,sheet,name)`](macro(file,sheet,name))), then the updated value of `num1` would persist when
the macro has been executed. However, invoked via the `macroFlex` command, the data variable changes are localized 
within the macro itself.

During execution, the [base &raquo; `verbose(text)`](verbose(text)) command in the macro would print out:
```
The sum is 42
```

This is as one would expects. This demonstrates the value of `num1` updated by the preceding
[number &raquo; `increment(var,amount)`](../number/increment(var,amount)) command.

However the [base &raquo; `verbose(text)`](verbose(text)) command in the script (last line) would print out:
```
37 + 5 = 42
```

Ths means that the value of `num1` is retained and unaffected by the invoked macro. This is the concept of data 
localization (or, data ephemerality). Within the scope of the macro execution, data variable changes are localized.
When a macro is finished, the affected data variables are restored to their respective value. For those that are
geek-at-heart or developers by trait, you might recognize this as a form of "_pass-by-value_". Moreover one can 
optionally assign any data variable created or modified within a macro to another data variable (via the `output` 
parameter). If such assignment is not needed, one can simply ignore the "output" generated by the invoked macro.

Note in the example script above, the `$(projectfile)` built-in function was used to reference the macro. More 
information about this, visit the [`$(profilefile|macro)`](../../functions/$(projectfile)#projectfilemacrofilesheetname) page. 


### Parameters
- **macro** - refers to the macro to invoke via the [`$(projectfile|macro)`](../../functions/$(projectfile)) built-in 
  function. Detail such as macro file, sheet and macro name must be provided. 
- **input** - refers to one or more input assignment represented in the form of `key=value`, each assignment in separate 
  line. The `key` will be localized variable (of the macro) and `value` will be its value. 
- **output** - refers to one or more output assignment represented in the form of `key=value`, each assignment in 
  separate line. Here, `key` represents the data variable "exported" from the macro, and `value` represents the data 
  variable to receive the exported value.


### Example
In below example, this macro accepts values for `url`, `title`, `searchButtonLoc` and `sectionLoc`. Also, it passes 
result data values back to script like `matched` to `result1` in this example. In this case, if user have variable 
`matched` outside this macro (probably in script or data), it will not be overridden. So, `matched` variable
will be accessible within this macro only. User can specify multiple output params in separate lines.
