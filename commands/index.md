Nexial commands are the _operative_ to carry out the smallest unit of automation. In many ways it is synonymous
to a "step". It is the contiguous collection of many "steps" that make up an automation script, or even automation 
suite.

In Nexial, a command is either an "action" or a validation. In other words, we are automating to either carry out an
operation (e.g. run a query, click on a button, move a file) or validating that the expected condition is met (e.g.
check if a table contains the expected transaction, assert if a online form accepts more than 50 characters for name).
